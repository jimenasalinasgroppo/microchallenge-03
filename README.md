Group 1 - Teacher Dashboard  - Facilitating Perception Board Sessions
===
Group Members: Jimena, Ariel and Wen

## Table of Contents

[TOC]

## Initial idea
*Initial idea / Concept of the Project (aligned to research areas).*

Our initial idea is to visualize the futures imagined by children in our first intervention creating collages wth them to create a digital gallery that can act as an exhibit that we share back with teachers and parents to raise funds as NFTs.

In parallel, we also want to create a Menti-like app for teachers facilitating Perception board sessions. 

## Purpose
*What is supposed to do or not to do.*

Mobile app that allows teachers to facilitate Perception board sessions and that also compiles futures generated and imagined by their classrooms.

### What


### Who
Our goal would be to integrate the tool into a session with teachers wishing to run Perception Board sessions and futures literacy programs to imagine futures.

### Where

Classroom settings (secondary)

### How

This can be done through a workshop or a small game session.



| Imagined futures by children                                                                              |     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| New animals are imagined by humans and they are placed in the zoos                    |     |
| Poor children go to a school and are fed                                              |     |
| Police capture bad man that kills animals and puts him in jail                        |     |
| A future with no zoos and where animals are treated well                              |     |
| Animals are trained to be strong to compete in sports competitions                    |     |
| Humans live with wild animals and humans feed them                                    |     |
| Animals are treated like our family without killing the environment                   |     |
| In sports competitions, humans can play any clothes they want. There are no uniforms. |     |
| One sports arena where all the sports in the world can be played in the same place.   |     |
| Parks of the future have animals and fruits and cars are forbidden.                   |     |
| A school where you can bring your own pokemon to class                                |     |
| In the zoos of the future there are giant snakes and horses are tiny.                 |     |
| Its forbidden to hunt animals and humans are friends with animals.                    |     |
| Trapped animals in the jungle are rescued by a man                                    |     |

### Design Process


**AI-powered design process**
We started asking Chat GPT how to visualize the futures imagined by the children and to walk us step by step into how to use Dall-E or midjourney to create these images.

We also used a Figma plug in to outline a first draft for the app using Wire Gen. 

Figma file https://www.figma.com/file/eZKuFNFJQ4wFc4Pbzoma0y/Big-Little-Futures---Teacher-app?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=oBjVotu6YoqOopZ8-0

Santi feedback (Day 1):
- App that takes an input and creates an image or create a web with images generated? 
- Image from text you need an account, etc. Using an API allows everyone to use without an account.
- A gallery of images that showcases the futures.
- Idea: Use Midjourney through Discord and join Midjourney channel to send prompts and generate images.
- Do you want to use this interface as something else than a digital portfolio? Could be printed cards with the imagery. 
- Other ideas: text - image - and the image is input for something. We are missing one extra step.
- Temperature parameter in Chat GPT which is the degree of how strict that the answer given is. Works similarly for images. (0-1, 1 being more creative).
- Questions: Once you have the AI powered image, how can we incorporate that? Can we build suggestions on top of that?
- Design constraint: We can't generate images in real-time. Input: voice to text

Day 1 Group feedback
- Generate specific style of image, i.e. children drawing aesthetic
- Reference of: Ticket of dolphin
- Think closely of the why you are doing this - i.e. Generate a feedback loop between teenagers and children
- Be specific with AI prompts
- Prioritize and start with most important question
- Maybe you don't need a digital interface, maybe its a printed poster or a website
- Design the system and the technicalities
